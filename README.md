## Overview
 
 Here I used:

 1- Grid

 2- Flexbox

 3- Less use of margins and more of padding

 4- Importing fonts

 5- Structuring content inside grid containers 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

![](~/)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

This was my how-to-guide, use it as you wish!

- First we set a basic structure for the HTML where we set up the container, wrapper and boxes.

- Then with the style-guide.md we select the fonts and all the necessary elements for the challenge.

- We import the fonts from google fonts, personally I had an issue with a particular font ('Big shoulders Display'), so I linked it directly to the HTML.

- Insert the svg images as you like, by your own device or by drawing the svg directly in the HTML.

- Then in a stylesheet, separate each important section of the document to address every part with order.

- In the variables and assets section, create the variables and import your fonts.

- In card components style each container, thereby I mean the container, wrapper and boxes in this case.

- The major display here was flexbox to set easily the whole structure.

- Set up a wrapper to display boxes in a grid container.

- Used border radius and overflow to round and hide the corners from the main container.

- Added double classes to boxes in the HTML to address easier each box and common elements, such as the anchor, paragraph and headings.

- Padding the inner content of boxes to eliminate complications with text.

- In the content section, you add styles to the paragraph, here go the fonts, colors, styling of the anchor, margins and the transition of fading the anchor.

- Lastly the media queries where adapted to turn the grid columns from 3 to 1, this using as advantage the logic from grid, where all elements fit inside a single column without overlapping each other.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
